# Ovation_RRBS
This repository contains scripts for processing of raw (fastq) files produced with the Tecan Ovation RRBS Methyl-seq library preparation protocol (methylation only).
I have also added the Tecan/Nugen scripts, which are sourced from their original repositories and all further information on utilising these is available there:
